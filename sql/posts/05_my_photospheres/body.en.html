<p>So I have been running around with my Motorola Nexus 6, branded by Google. It is, by and large, just another Android phone, albeit that it is big, fast, and, curiously enough, it is one of the few android phones that comes with the ability to take photospheres.</p>

<h2>Photosphere? What is that?</h2>

<p>A photosphere is a panoramic photo that encompases a field of view of 360 degrees in all directions. So by looking at the picture, not only would you be able to see in all horizontal directions (left and right), but also you would be able to see the sky and the ground.</p>

<p>Technically, Imagine you are inside a hollow sphere, and you can see the surface of that sphere from inside. Now imagine that sphere has a wall paper covering it. You initially cannot see the seams, and wonder how the rectangular wallpaper was placed so seamlessly on a sphere from inside.</p>

<p>After a while, you take a better look and you notice that, The wallpaper in the horizon looks relatively normal, but in the bottom and in the top, the wall paper is sort of compressed. Its difficult to notice because the wallpaper compensates for that compression, by streching itself in the bottom and on the top. And that is what escentially is a 360 degree panoramic photo: a single large image with the horizon crossing the ecuator, and then gradially stretching itself in the top and in the bottom.</p>
