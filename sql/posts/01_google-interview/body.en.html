<p>So yes, I was close to getting hired by google. I did not pass, however, despite the fact that I studied hard, read all the source material, read Cracking the Code Interview book, as well as practice coding in online platforms such as LeetCode.com, HackerRank.com, and OnlineJudge.</p>

<p>But in the end, it wasn't all bad. I learned very important lessons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>I actually have a shot.</li>
	<li>It's not as hard as it may seem.</li>
	<li>If you don't make it, you can try again next year.</li>
</ol>

<p>The day the recruiter called me to inform that my recruitment process was not going to continue, I was devastated sure, but she also told me that 60% of Google employees do not pass the first phone screen. I don't know if that was supposed to cheer me up, but it did, and I will very likely try again next year when the cooldown period expires.</p>

<p>So, what was it like to interview for Google? Well, if for some reason you are reading this, chances are you have already have searched for sources on Google and Youtube, and if you haven't then... What are you waiting for?</p>

<p>But, if you are still interested in my training experience, well here it is! To train, I did the following.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Register to online coding sites: including HackerRank.com, OnlineJudge.org, and LeetCode.com.</li>
	<li>Practice coding.</li>
	<li>Learn how to properly calculate Big-O on your code.</li>
	<li>Read the book Cracking the Code Interview and practice its exercises.</li>
	<li>Practice more coding.</li>
	<li>Search YouTube for google interview samples.</li>
	<li>Practice even more coding.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the interview, speak your mind! let the interviewer know what you are thinking at all times, so he can learn about your creative process.</p>

<p>All right! so far, It appears I did everything right... right? Well, I did not pass, so something clearly went wrong... Maybe it was my mistake in calculating Big-O? Maybe it was my lack of assertiveness? Maybe I was not the best in my hiring pool? Whatever it may be, I will try again, and the best I can do for you is give you the sources.</p>

<p>The takeaway of all this is that you must understand you are not being evaluated on your ability to remember the solutions to hard problems that have already been solved, but rather, they will evaluate your creative process, how you approach solving a problem for which you have no idea how to solve. You may not solve it as efficiently or quickly but at least you must let the interviewer know what you are thinking at all times.</p>

<p>So, in summary, read Cracking the Code Interview, search youtube for Google Interview videos, and practice, practice and practice. You can practice coding in these sites.</p>

<p>I hope this small post helps someone kickstart their dream to work at Google, I don't know if I will ever work there, but I will try again next year, and the Universe willing, the year after that.</p>
